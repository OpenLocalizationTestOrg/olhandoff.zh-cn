Containers, and the ecosystem that is developing around them, will empower software developers to create the next generation of applications experiences.\n\nWatch a short overview: [Windows-based containers: Modern app development with enterprise-grade control](https://youtu.be/Ryx3o0rD5lY ).\n\n##What are containers?\n\nThey are an isolated, resource controlled, and portable operating environment.\n\nBasically, a container is an isolated place where an application can run without affecting the rest of the system and without the system affecting the application. Containers are the next evolution in virtualization.\n\nIf you were inside a container, it would look very much like you were inside a freshly installed physical computer or a virtual machine. And, to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a Windows Server Container can be managed in the same way as any other container.\n\n## Container Fundamentals\n\nWhen you begin working with containers you will notice many similarities between a container and a virtual machine. A container runs an operating system, has a file system and can be accessed over a network just as if it was a physical or virtual computer system. That said, the technology and concepts behind containers are very different from that of virtual machines.  \n[This blog post](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/08/17/containers-docker-windows-and-trends/) by Mark Russinovich explains containers well.\n\nThe following key concepts will be helpful as you begin creating and working with Windows Server Containers. \n\n**Container Host:** Physical or Virtual computer system configured with the Windows Server Container feature. The container host will run one or more Windows Server Containers.\n\n**Container Image:** As modifications are made to a containers file system or registry, such as with software installation they are captured in the sandbox.  In many cases you may want to capture this state such that new containers can be created that inherit these changes. That’s what an image is – once the container has stopped you can either discard that sandbox or you can convert it into a new container image. For example, let’s imagine that you have deployed a container from the Windows Server Core OS image. You then install MySQL into this container. Creating a new image from this container would act as a deployable version of the container. This image would only contain the changes made (MySQL), however would work as a layer on top of the Container OS Image.\n\n**Sandbox:** Once a container has been started, all write actions such as file system modifications, registry modifications or software installations are captured in this ‘sandbox’ layer.  \n \n**Container OS Image:** Containers are deployed from images. The container OS image is the first layer in potentially many image layers that make up a container. This image provides the operating system environment. A Container OS Image is Immutable, it cannot be modified.\n\n**Container Repository:** Each time a container image is created the container image and its dependencies are stored in a local repository. These images can be reused many times on the container host. The container images can also be stored in a public or private repository such as DockerHub so that they can be used across many different container host.\n\n**Container Management Technology:** Windows Server Containers can be managed using both PowerShell and Docker.
